To integrate speech recognition for activating special moves in our 2D fighter 
game, we will employ a speech-to-text API that interprets player voice commands. 
This feature will allow players to unleash unique character abilities or special 
moves by speaking specific phrases or words. The speech recognition system will 
continuously listen for predefined commands during gameplay and, upon detecting 
a valid phrase, trigger the corresponding special move in the game. This adds an 
innovative layer of interaction, enhancing player engagement and strategy.
