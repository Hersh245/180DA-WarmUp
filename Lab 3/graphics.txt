In our project, a gesture-controlled 2D fighter game, we will use Pygame for graphics. 
Pygame will handle sprite animations, crucial for depicting character movements linked 
to player gestures. We'll use Pygame's capabilities to draw environments and backgrounds, 
making the game visually appealing. For characters, Pygame allows us to load, manipulate, 
and animate images based on gesture input. It also offers collision detection, essential 
for implementing fighting mechanics like hits and blocks. UI elements, including health 
bars and menus, will also be created using Pygame, ensuring a clear and functional interface.
